Ever since I was a kid, art has been a way for me to understand and express the world and my world. On this website, I offer a glimpse into my world, the exploration of the arts, architecture and projects that I am learning.\nMy interest in new media and learning more about the online world, comes from my journey with design. My journey with design has just began and I would like to explore and showcase as much as I can. I would like to influence and infuse my design with art to show a side that is unique to myself. My strength in art lies in oil painting, I have been painting for 4 years and I was awarded “highly commended” and shortlisted for UOB painting of the year 2008 and 2023 respectively.\nMy journey in design started in architecture school and it has impacted the way I view the world. Architecture is not only about buildings, but it is also about the people who inhabit these buildings.\nOn this website, you will find a selection of my artworks, architecture projects and design works. I invite you to explore my website and learn more about my life’s work.Please feel free to contact me if you have any commissions or enquirers on projects.\n\nInstagram"
